# Malaria-Image-Processing-Prediction-Model

Developed and trained a Malaria Binary Image Classification Deep Neural Network model which detects the presence of malaria as a parasite in blood cells using dataset of red blood cell images. The dataset was leveraged from Kaggle, originally from the NIH. The dataset contains over 27.6K (the number includes both infected and uninfected datasets). The model is a 70% train, 20% Validation and 10% testing. Achieved a 95.75% accuracy rates and 95% validation accuracy.
